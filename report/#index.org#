* _QUESTION-WISE REPORT_
** LEVEL 1 
*** QUESTION 1-1
    In this question,I have made use of *tar -tf* command to list the contents 
of a.tar file or .tar.gz file without actually extracting it.

*** QUESTION 1-2
    Here ,I have made use of *ps t-* command to list the processes not associated 
with terminal.
** LEVEL 2
*** QUESTION 2-1
    In this question,we have to simulate *echo -n* command. So, I have made use 
of $*. $* helps us to print all the parameters that we give with the command line.

*** QUESTION 2-2
    In this , I first used *ps aux* to list all processes.Then I reverse sorted them
on the basis of their size and used *head -1* to select the first process and then 
extracted the name of process using *cut*.

*** QUESTION 2-3
    I used *who -s* first to list all users logged on the system along with their 
some other information. And then extracted the first field(name field) of the 
_users_.
  
*** QUESTION 2-4
    To remove the process associated with the *grep* from the long list that comes 
after doing *ps elf | grep firefox* I have used *grep -v grep* because v with grep
reverse the sense of matching.i.e.print those lines which dont have grep in them.

** LEVEL 3
*** QUESTION 3-1
    I used *find -maxdepth 2 type -f -ls* to display the files along with their sizes
upto 2 levels and then as 2-2 reverse sorted the list based on size and extracted the
name of largest file.

*** QUESTION 3-2
    I first listed the files with ~ using *grep* and *ls* and counted no of obtained
files using *wc -l* and then using *rm* in a loop recursively deleted the obtained
files.

*** QUESTION 3-3
    First,I found out the PID of *flash video* and then open that pid folder in /proc
and listed the flv files and then copied the id of
